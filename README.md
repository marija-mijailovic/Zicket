# Zicket

Zicket tackles a very interesting scalping problem that Vitalik Buterin, at ETH Mexico raised. The issue of people buying multiple conference tickets simultaneously. This indicates that this is an open problem and that there arenâ€™t any solutions. Solving this issue will help prevent ticket misuse by destroying the incentive to resell tickets and making bots redundant.

:eyes: How to solve this?
